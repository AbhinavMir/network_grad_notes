## Network interfaces

A network interface is a point of communication between a computer and a network. It is typically a physical device that connects a computer to a LAN, such as a router or switch, but it can also refer to a software interface, such as a virtual LAN. Network interfaces provide the means for computers to exchange data and access shared resources, such as the internet, over a network. They can also provide additional functions, such as security, Quality of Service, and network address translation.

## What is Data Link Layer?

The data link layer is the second layer of the OSI model and is responsible for providing a reliable link between two adjacent nodes on a network. It is responsible for detecting, correcting, and controlling errors that occur in the physical layer, which is the physical connection between two nodes. It also provides the means for flow control and media access control. It is typically implemented in hardware and software.

## What are the major functions of the Data Link Layer?

The major functions of the data link layer are: 

1. Framing: The data link layer divides the data received from the network layer into frames, which are pieces of data that can be transferred over the physical layer.

2. Error Detection and Correction: The data link layer is responsible for detecting and correcting errors that occur in the physical layer.

3. Flow Control: The data link layer is responsible for controlling the flow of data over the physical layer.

4. Media Access Control: The data link layer is responsible for controlling the access to the shared media, such as Ethernet.

## Explain Bit oriented framing

Bit oriented framing is a method of data transmission that divides data into individual bits and transmits them over a communication channel. Each bit is assigned a unique identifier, which is used to identify the data being transmitted. It is used in a variety of communication protocols, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and X.25. Bit oriented framing is an efficient way of sending data over a network, as it allows data to be sent quickly and accurately.

## Example:

In the Ethernet protocol, bit-oriented framing is used to send data over a network. Each frame is identified by a unique identifier, called a preamble. The preamble is followed by a start-of-frame (SFD) delimiter and a destination address. The data is then sent in a series of bits, followed by a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to detect any errors in the data. Finally, an end-of-frame (EOD) delimiter is sent to indicate the end of the frame.

## What is a Shared LANs (Multiple-Access Links)

A shared LAN (local area network) is a type of network that allows multiple devices to connect to the same network. In this type of network, each device has access to all of the resources on the network, such as files, printers, and Internet access. The most common type of shared LAN is an Ethernet network, which uses a twisted-pair cable to connect devices. Shared LANs are used in offices and homes, as well as for larger networks, such as those that provide Internet access.
