## What is routing in networking? 

Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network data. Routers create an overlay network by using the routing information exchanged via routing protocols. This information is used to construct a logical map of the network, which can then be used to determine the best path for data to travel from its source to its destination.

â†’ Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnets. All the subnets are connected and communicate with each other through routers. Each subnet has its own routing table, which is used to route the traffic within the subnet. Routers are used to route the traffic between different subnets.
