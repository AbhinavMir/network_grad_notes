## Congestion window size in networks

In computer networking, the congestion window size is a parameter used in network congestion control. It is the maximum amount of data that can be sent over a network connection without receiving an acknowledgment that the data has been received on the other end. The window size is adjusted during the course of data transfers to properly balance the rate at which data is sent and received. This helps to avoid network congestion. The window size is typically adjusted by the sender and is constrained by the size of the network's receive window. The congestion window size is important for ensuring timely data delivery and efficient use of network resources.

### Overall categories of congestion control

1. AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease): AIMD is the most commonly used congestion control protocol, and it is the basis of the TCP congestion control algorithm. Additive Increase means that the sender increases its transmission rate by a fixed amount each RTT, while Multiplicative Decrease means that the sender reduces its transmission rate by a fixed factor when it detects congestion. 
2. Window-based Congestion Control: Window-based congestion control protocols use the size of the congestion window as the primary mechanism for controlling the rate of data transmission. This allows the sender to control the rate at which data is sent, depending on the size of the congestion window. 
3. Rate-based Congestion Control: Rate-based congestion control protocols use the rate of data transmission as the primary mechanism for controlling the rate of data transmission. This allows the sender to adjust its transmission rate depending on the current network conditions. 
4. Loss-based Congestion Control: Loss-based congestion control protocols use packet loss as the primary mechanism for controlling the rate of data transmission. This allows the sender to adjust its transmission rate depending on the amount of packet loss that is experienced.
5. Delay-Based Congestion Control: Delay-based congestion control protocols use packet delay as the primary mechanism for controlling the rate of data transmission. This allows the sender to adjust its transmission rate depending on the amount of packet delay that is experienced. 
6. Network-Aware Congestion Control: Network-aware congestion control protocols use information about the network conditions as the primary mechanism for controlling the rate of data transmission. This allows the sender to adjust its transmission rate depending on the overall network conditions.

### Congestion avoidance pseudocode

```c++
if (cwnd < ssthresh) // if we're still doing
// slow-start, open window exponentially
	cwnd += 1
else // otherwise do Congestion Avoidance
// linear increase
	cwnd += 1/cwnd
```

## Basics: Slow Start

Slow start is a congestion control algorithm used in TCP to gradually increase the amount of data that can be sent over a network in order to prevent congestion. The algorithm works by starting with a small congestion window size, and then doubling that size each Round Trip Time (RTT) until it reaches a predetermined maximum. This allows the sender to gradually increase the amount of data it sends, while giving the network time to adjust to the increased load. Once the congestion window reaches the maximum, the sender will use the congestion avoidance algorithm to maintain the current rate of data transmission.

## Basics: CWND (Congestion Window)

Congestion Window (CWND) is a protocol used in networks to control the rate of data transmission between two hosts. It works by setting a maximum window size based on the amount of data that can be sent without overloading the network, and then gradually increasing the window size as more data is sent without experiencing packet loss. This ensures that the network is not overloaded and that data is sent as efficiently as possible. CWND is an important part of network congestion control and is used in protocols such as TCP and UDP.

CWND is halved in the network when a packet is lost or dropped due to congestion. This is a mechanism used to reduce the amount of data sent over the network and to prevent congestion from occurring. When a packet is lost, the congestion window is halved as a means of reducing the amount of data sent in a given time period. This helps to prevent congestion and allows the network to function more efficiently.

## Basics: AIMD

AIMD (Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease) is a congestion control algorithm used by transport layer protocols such as TCP. The algorithm works by increasing the transmission rate of the sender (additive increase) until a packet loss is detected, which indicates congestion. At this point, the sender decreases the rate (multiplicative decrease) to try and avoid further losses. This process then repeats until the sender finds a rate that allows the packets to be sent without any packet loss. This rate is then the equilibrium rate at which the sender will continue to send packets.

*In practice*: Increment a little for each ACK Increment = $(MSS * MSS)/CongestionWindow$, $CongestionWindow += Increment$. MSS is Maximum Segment Size.

## How does fast retransmission work?

Fast retransmission is a technique used in TCP to detect and recover from lost packets quickly. It works by having the sender continuously monitor the acknowledgments it receives from the receiver. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment within a certain time period, it will assume that the packet was lost and retransmit it. This allows the sender to quickly detect and recover from packet losses, reducing the overall impact of congestion on the network.

By default, 2 ACKs elicit a retransmission, but in some cases, such as fast transmit in some Reno setups need 3 ACKs.

## TCP Reno

TCP Reno is a congestion control algorithm used in TCP to manage network congestion. It is based on the standard TCP algorithm, but with a few modifications. TCP Reno uses the same Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance algorithms as regular TCP, but also implements fast retransmission and fast recovery. Fast retransmission is used to detect and recover from lost packets quickly, while fast recovery allows the sender to increase the congestion window size quickly after a packet loss. This helps to reduce the amount of time needed to recover from packet losses and helps to reduce the overall impact of congestion on the network.

The congestion window size for TCP Reno is given by the equation: 

$W = min(2W_{last}, W_{max}, W_{last}+\alpha \times MSS)$

where $W_{last}$ is the congestion window size in the last RTT, $W_{max}$ is the maximum congestion window size, MSS is the Maximum Segment Size, and $\alpha$ is a scaling factor.

### How widely is TCP Reno used?

TCP Reno is widely used as the default congestion control protocol for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the Internet. It is the most commonly used implementation of the TCP protocol, and is used by the majority of the world's Internet service providers. It is also used by many applications, such as web browsers and file transfer programs, to ensure reliable data transmission over the Internet.

#### Sample Question

Consider sending a large file from one host to another over a TCP-Reno connection. Assume that the connection has reached steady state, and its congestion window is now oscillating between 8 and 16 segments in AIMD (without slow start, i.e. a loss event at congestion window = 16 is always detected by triple duplicate acknowledgments). Assume the TCP source is not limited by flow control.

(a) Assuming approximately constant round-trip times (RTT), where RTT = 100ms, in steady state, how long does it take between two consecutive loss events? Assume that it takes roughly one RTT to detect loss.

*Answer*: $(16-8+1)*100 = 900 m/s$

This is because the congestion window is oscillating between 8 and 16 segments. Since it takes roughly one RTT to detect loss, it takes 900ms for the congestion window to increase from 8 to 16 segments, and then another RTT to detect the loss.

(b) What is the average sending rate for this connection?

*Answer*: The average sending rate for this connection is 12 segments per round trip time (RTT). This is calculated by taking the average of the congestion window size (8 + 16) / 2. Since the congestion window size oscillates between 8 and 16 segments, the average sending rate is 12 segments per RTT.

(c) Now suppose this connection shares the bottleneck link with another long-lived TCP-Reno connection. What would be the average sending rate of each connection? Assume that both connections have the same RTT and are synchronized in their updates of their congestion windows.

*Answer:* $\lambda_{1} = \lambda_{2} =120/2 = 60 \text{ segments/s}$

### Sample Question

Suppose that you are using an extended version of TCP Reno that allows window sizes much larger than 64K bytes.1 Suppose you are using it over a 1Gbps link with a round-trip time (RTT) of 200ms to transfer 16M-byte file, and the TCP receiver's advertised window is 2M bytes. If TCP sends 1K-byte segments, and assuming no congestion and no lost segments: 

(a) how many RTTs does it take until the sender's congestion window reaches 2M bytes? Recall that the congestion window is initialized to the size of a single segment, and assume that the slow-start threshold is initialized to a value higher than the receiverâ€™s advertised window. 

*Answer:* So basically 

$$$
ssthresh_{init}>aws = 2Mb, R(t)=1Gbps, cwnd_{init} = 1 segment, RTT=200ms, O(file)=16Mb, segmentSize = 1Kb
$$$

First, let's calculate number of TCP segments needed for 2MBs, which is 2Mb/1Kb = 2000 segements. Now we know slow start [doubles window size](https://github.com/AbhinavMir/network_grad_notes/blob/main/congestion_control.md#basics-slow-start) till it gets a negative acknowledgement in some form (or till it reaches advertised window size)

(b) How many RTTs does it take to send the file? 

(c) If the time to send the file is given by the number of required RTTs times the RTT value, what is the effective throughput for the transfer? What percentage of the link capacity is utilized?

## TCP Tahoe

TCP Tahoe is a congestion control algorithm used in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to regulate the amount of data sent over a network. The algorithm works by monitoring the network for congestion, and then using a set of rules to regulate the flow of data.

The main goal of TCP Tahoe is to prevent congestion on the network by controlling the amount of data sent at any given time. The algorithm works by adjusting the window size of the sender, which is the amount of data that can be sent without waiting for an acknowledgment from the receiver.

The math behind TCP Tahoe involves several parameters that are used to determine the optimal window size. These parameters include the round-trip time (RTT), the packet loss rate, and the throughput. The window size is then calculated using the following formula:

$Window size = min(RTT * throughput, packet loss rate * RTT).$

The window size is then adjusted based on the current network conditions. If the network is congested, the window size is decreased, and if the network is not congested, the window size is increased. This allows TCP Tahoe to regulate the flow of data and prevent network congestion.

#### Sample Question
